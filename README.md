# release-firefox-addon

This action publishes a Firefox add-on to the AMO (addons.mozilla.org).

## Usage

The minimal usage is as follows:

```yaml
steps:
- uses: browser-actions/release-firefox-addon@latest
  with:
    addon-id: "please specify your add-on in number or UUID format, or add-on name"
    addon-path: "path/to/your/addon.zip"
    auth-api-issuer: ${{ secrets.AUTH_API_ISSUER }}
    auth-api-secret: ${{ secrets.AUTH_API_SECRET }}
```

The `auth-api-issuer` and `auth-api-secret` are used to authenticate with the AMO API with JWT token. You can get credentials from [here](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/developers/addon/api/key/).

If your add-on includes minified files or transpiled files, you should submit your add-on with source code.

```yaml
steps:
- uses: browser-actions/release-firefox-addon@latest
  with:
    addon-id: "please specify your add-on in number or UUID format, or add-on name"
    addon-path: "path/to/your/addon.zip"
    source-path: "path/to/your/source-code.zip"
    approval-note: |
      The source project requires Node.js 20.x and yarn v3.
      To generate the source code, please run ...
    auth-api-issuer: ${{ secrets.AUTH_API_ISSUER }}
    auth-api-secret: ${{ secrets.AUTH_API_SECRET }}
```
